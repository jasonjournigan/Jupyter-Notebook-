For this journal entry, I’ll be reflecting on my work in the course, particularly focusing on the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, and providing insight into my experience with reinforcement learning and neural networks. Below is an outline of my answers to the prompts in the portfolio reflection.

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, I was tasked with developing an intelligent agent capable of navigating an environment to maximize rewards. The environment itself was built around a pirate character that needed to navigate obstacles, avoid enemies, and collect treasure. The code I was given included the basic setup of the environment, along with some core functions that allowed for interaction with the world. However, the core of the work was creating the intelligent agent that could learn to navigate this environment through reinforcement learning.

I created the agent’s decision-making process from scratch using Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning technique. I coded the training process for the agent, which involved adjusting the Q-values (action values) through exploration and exploitation of the environment. I also implemented functions to update the agent’s state based on rewards it received, which in turn helped it improve its strategy over time.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? Computer scientists design and implement algorithms, data structures, and systems that solve complex problems and improve our ability to process and analyze information. In this course, I learned how to apply concepts like reinforcement learning and neural networks to real-world problems, and these skills are essential in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and data science. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize industries by improving efficiency, solving problems previously considered too complex, and creating smarter systems.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. First, I break down the problem into smaller, manageable components. In the case of the Pirate Intelligent Agent, the problem involved creating an agent that could learn to make decisions in an uncertain environment, which I broke down into steps like defining the states, actions, and rewards. I then choose appropriate tools and algorithms—like Q-learning in this case—and iteratively improve upon my solution through testing and adjustments. I also value collaboration and seek help when needed, leveraging resources such as documentation, online communities, and colleagues.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the systems I develop are reliable, secure, and do not cause harm to users. I must ensure that any data I handle is protected and used responsibly. In the case of the Pirate Intelligent Agent, while there were no direct privacy concerns, the underlying principle of ethical responsibility is still relevant: I should ensure the agent operates fairly and transparently, not allowing for manipulation or unintended consequences. For organizations, I have a responsibility to build systems that align with business goals while considering long-term impacts, especially when deploying technologies like AI, which can affect jobs and privacy.

Reflection:
This project, and the course as a whole, helped solidify my understanding of reinforcement learning and neural networks. I now feel more confident in applying these concepts to solve complex problems and am excited to explore more advanced techniques in the future. The work also underscored the importance of ethical considerations in the development of AI technologies. The potential for AI to affect society in profound ways means that computer scientists must always remain mindful of how they design and deploy these systems.
